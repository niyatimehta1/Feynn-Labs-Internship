# Feynn-Labs-Internship
Projects performed as a Machine Learning intern at Feynn Labs

## Project 1: AI Product/Service Ideation
For this project, I proposed the idea of creating a Furniture E-commerce app which helps to harnesses the power of technology to benefit individuals. This app employs AI, machine learning (ML), and augmented reality (AR) to offer an engaging experience where users can scan furniture items and then view or imagine them within their own living spaces. This innovative approach replaces the conventional method of furniture shopping, making it more convenient. Additionally, it serves as a platform to enhance the visibility and accessibility of small-scale furniture retailers.

## Project 2: Market Segmentation
Market segmentation study task: Here I was supposed to get familiar with market segmentation concepts and performed market segmentation on a MC Donald's dataset.
Market segmentation on Indian Electronic Vehicle(EV) industry: Here, I conducted market segmentation and analysis on the EV market in India.

Dataset Details:
1. State wise distribution of 2,3,4 wheeler EV s and passenger cars in India
2. Brands and models of EVs in India with their attributes
Finally, based on the market segmentation I made a profile for each EV cluster and mentioned the EV s belonging to that cluster such that viable market entry startegies are created for EV s in each cluster based on geography and demographics.

## Project 3: Financial Modelling
For this project I  performed Business Modelling for the AI product idea of FurniSpace proposed in Project 1. This model included various aspects like The actual Business Model, The revenue Streams for FurniSpace and the Financial Equations.
